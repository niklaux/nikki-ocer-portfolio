              I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and
              have a strong passion for web development. I began learning about
              web development during the global pandemic in my senior year at
              university. By the time I landed my first job in 2023, I had
              already become proficient in the MERN (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS,
              Node) stack, which played a key role in securing the position.

              Since then, Iâ€™ve continued to grow as a developer, taking on new
              challenges and learning new technologies along the way. Thanks to
              my current work experience, I am now well-versed in Next.js,
              Material UI, TypeScript, Django, and designing small-scale
              databases.
